            <section class="flex-area" id="about-section">
                <p> I'm an enthusiastic and versatile student, double majoring in Communications Media and New Media Digital Design with a concentration in Art, Text, and Design. My journey spans a range of disciplines, including UX/UI Design, Website Development, Graphic Design, Communications, Marketing, Digital Storytelling, Journalism, Computer Science, and Editing. Throughout my experience in New Media Digital Design, I've actively participated in diverse projects, conducting interviews, creating surveys, and implementing solutions. My Graphic Design expertise seamlessly integrates with broader communication skills, allowing me to craft visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I leverage my creativity in UI front-end development to bring designs to life, ensuring an engaging user experience while applying my knowledge of coding and computer science principles. In Communications Media, I specialize in crafting narratives through scriptwriting and editing, finding joy in shaping stories that captivate and establish meaningful connections. This unique blend of design, coding, and communication empowers me to navigate the best of both worlds, fusing creativity with storytelling for immersive and engaging outcomes.</p>
