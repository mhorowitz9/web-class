        After the tragic death of her husband, Mel Monroe, a nurse and midwife, 
        yearns to begin a fresh start to escape her grief. 
        Mel immediately accepts a job to practice her profession in a small rural 
        town far away from her city life by seeking to replace her once hectic 
        city life with one of privacy and serenity. 
        Despite Virgin River's small population, her life still includes unexpected
         hurdles, and she could never picture herself falling in love with the restaurateur and former marine Jack.

                Mel is the main character, and she is a nurse and midwife. While Mel is friendly and caring, she holds back on revealing her past to the people of Virgin River. Throughout the book, Mel vents about her hardships to her only family, her sister, Joey, who lives back in the city. When Mel meets Jack, she tries to resist her feelings towards him due to the tragic death of her husband, ER doctor, Mark, in a robbery a few months ago. As Mel gets to know Jack, she eventually opens up to him, and their relationship grows stronger.

                <h4>Embrace Community </h4>
                <img src ="images/virginrivercommunity.jpg" alt ="Virgin River Community" class="center" width="400" height="250">
                <p> Virgin River is a small town; therefore, a limited group of people can do specific jobs. As a result, for better functioning of the town, people step up by helping each other when they can. For example, Jack's restaurant is one of the main ones in Virgin River, and he offers excellent prices instead of increasing them to allow people to afford high-quality food. On the internal level, the community displays kindness and compassion towards one another by welcoming Mel despite her being from a big city.  </p>
