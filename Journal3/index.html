                Throughout this class, I have learned to communicate and design my ideas with code. As a creative person, this enhanced my growth because it enabled me to experiment with interactivity for a website user. Before this class, I viewed art, technology, and visual culture as separate categories. Now, website design combines all these elements and allows people to create anything they want on the web. The possibilities are unlimited as there are countless coding languages to learn that will only strengthen someone's ability. As we discussed in class, every language offers a unique area of expertise; HTML is the architect, while CSS is the designer; both go side by side. I am delighted with my work because each one sharpened my skills. In the future, I am excited to continue my learning because this is just the doorway to many opportunities, especially as a person who loves art and technology. Thank you very much for an excellent semester!
