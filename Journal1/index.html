<p> 
        <br> Each book has a different purpose, whether that be exploring genres or just a cookbook. 
        <br> The covers are uniquely designed; some may be plain, while others are decorative.
        <br> Within books, there are chapters dividing that book into manageable sections. 
        <br> While reading the book, a person can reread chapters and skip other sections. 
        <br> You can even share that book with other people to read it. 
        <br> When you are finished reading, you might even be more knowledgeable about certain topics.

        <p> <br>  Filled with any books you want at any moment! <br> Websites can look wildly different from one another; once you go into that website, you can explore certain sections with the navigation bars. <br> Most importantly, every website has individual goals, one of the main reasons people display things online. From promoting a business to even reading a blog, there are endless possibilities.

   <p>  They will consist of artifacts and news articles from many years ago. Websites are the source of information, 
    therefore they will not become obsolete. <br> Websites are the new platform for communication between people, and it allows information to flow.
