                <p>Frank Chimero's <i> The Web's Grain  </i> gives an empowering message to website designers of breaking 
                    up tedious tasks into digestible chunks. He relates to his audience personally by 
                    sharing that he, too, can struggle with turning his vision into reality.

                   <q>We should be focusing on how they build up. 
                    And this concept, just like the layouts we create, can reach out a bit further

                    Although technology can sometimes be overwhelming because of its extensive features, we can use it to our advantage. 
                    One needs to have the right mentality to achieve goals; a person needs to have a growing mindset to 
                    learn to deal with mistakes.

                    In my website designing experience,
                    this is very motivating because practice makes perfect, especially when learning to code new computer languages.
                    Therefore, having a positive attitude is crucial when designing websites
                    because it takes devotion and effort to be fully immersed in each website.
